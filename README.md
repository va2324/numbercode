# Numbercode
This is a short Python program for creating a number for a password based on a standard phone keypad. 
When I have to create a password for a new account, I like to think of a word and then look for all its letters on a phone keypad.
Then I take the numbers where the letters are located and add them to the end of the password, such as "word#9673".
This Python program will automate this process and generate a numbercode when the user inputs a word.
